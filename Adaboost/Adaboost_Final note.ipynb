    "Before we dive into the details of the Adaboost algorithm, a brief overview of what Adaboost is and what it has to do with Machine Learning will prove useful to the uninitiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, what are we trying to achieve here? \n",
    "Basically, we are given a dataset. For each datapoint, we have measured and stored the value of some parameters of interest. \n",
    "We have also assigned each datapoint a **label**. That is, the dataset that we have is already classified. It could have been classified by a human or the label could be assigned on the basis of experimental/empirical observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's best explained by an example. So let's say we conducted a census in India. We choose our dataset to be a subset of all the census data that we have collected. We manually label all the data in our subset. Let's say that our subset contained a million people. Given that there are a billion people in India, we don't want to do the rest of the labelling by hand! This is where Adaboost comes in. We will used the data we have already labelled as **training data** and feed it into the Adaboost algorithm. Adaboost 'learns' from this data. Now if you feed it the rest of the census data, which was not labelled, it will generate those labels for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the census example, each datapoint actually represents a person. The parameters of interest include height, weight, income, assets owned, marital status etc. \n",
    "Here classification/labelling can mean anything: people can be classified into being above or below the poverty line. A more complex classification can be whether or not a person is eligible for a loan of (say) Rs. 10lakhs from a bank; more generally,  whether a person is credit worthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that both examples are **binary classifications**. Meaning that the labels can only be one of two values, like a simple yes or no. This is important because Adaboost assumes, and only works on binary classsified data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, so Adaboost stands for **Adaptive Boosting**. So what is it boosting, and why is it called adaptive?\n",
    "Let's go back to the census example and consider again the question of classifying the entire population of India as being eligible for a bank loan of Rs. 10 lakhs ie credit worthiness. I shall refer to this problem as credit worthiness henceforth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall some of the parameters that we record for each person: height, weight, income, assets owned, marital status.  \n",
    "Let's pick one parameter, say income. How would you generate a classifier for our dataset using only this parameter? \n",
    "That's easy: just pick a **threshold** say, an income of Rs 5 lakhs a year. This classifier will label any person with an income greater than 5 lakhs as being credit worthy and other people people as non credit worthy. \n",
    "We could have generated a different classifier by simply choosing a different threshold. Like an income of 10 lakhs a year.\n",
    "So here's the **important point:** a classifier can be uniquely generated by choosing a parameter, and a threshold for that parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in the census example, you must have realised that some parameters are more important than others: height and weight don't really have much to do with credit worthiness. Income and assets owned are definitely very important. In the real world, banks sometimes also factor in marital status(as a sign of being responsible). Now the obvious question is, how do we quantitatively combine income, assets, marital status etc. How much weightage should income, assets, marital status get in determining the final labels? What thresholds do we choose for these paramters?? \n",
    "All of these questions can be answered in one go: Ask the data! We have already classified some of the data. The magic of Adaboost is that it extracts all of this information about weights and thresholds for us.\n",
    "This is the **\"boosting\"** in Adaboost. It boosts the weightage of classifiers that are more relevant. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to define another term: **weak classifiers**. A weak classifier is just a classifier that is better than pure guessing. That is, it classifies more than half of the labelled data correctly. Even if it's success rate is just 51 % or even 50.01 %,, it still counts as a weak classifier. \n",
    "A **strong classifier** is one that has a very good success rate, like 99% or whatever.\n",
    "(The astute reader would point out that every strong classifier is also a weak classifier. That's really not the point. These are just heuristic definitiions used to convey obvious differences in success rates.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are in a position to understand the Adaboost algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Adaboost is iterative: In the first iteration, it picks the most accurate weak classifier. In the census example, it would most probably correspond to the parameter of income, with some threshold value(Note: classifiers that work with income as a parameter but have different threshold values are distinct classifiers).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) So we have picked our first weak classifier. Now what? Well, this weak classifier must have obviously misclassified a lot of datapoints(a little less than half). The classifier that we pick in the next iteration should then be better at correctly classifying this misclassified data. How do we choose such a classifier? The way it works in Adaboost is that **each data point is assigned a weight**. In the first iteration, obviously all the datapoints had equal weightage. Then the weight of the misclassified datapoints is incremented, and that of correctly labelled data is decremented. So the error rate of the second classifier is calculated as a weighted sum: if it misclassifies an already misclassified datapoint, it gets a higher error rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) In the second iteration, the classifier with the smallest error rate on the weighted data is chosen. Now we have chosen two weak classifiers. We again increment the weights of the datapoints that are collectively misclassified by the two weak classifiers, and decrement the weigths of the ones that they correctly classify.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Repeat this process of reassigning weights and picking weak classifiers on the weighted data until you have made the error rate as small as you like. Here we are referring to the error rate of the final strong classifier( what we form out of all the weak classifiers that we have picked so far).\n",
    "\n",
    "So in a nutshell: Adaboost takes a lot of weak classifiers, assigns them appropriate weights, to make a strong classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. So far, we haven't encountered a single mathematical equation! Now that we understand *what* Adaboost does, we need to look at *how* it works.\n"

The problem is simple to state: create a program that takes an image of a digit from 0-9 as input and gives as output, the digit in the picture.\n",
    "So how can we use Adaboost to solve this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, some specifics: The 'data' that we will use comprises of images that are 13 pixels wide and 13 pixels tall i.e **13x13**. The training set will have **1000 images**, as will the testing/validation set. Each image is stored as a 13x13 matrix. Each element of this matrix is a number from 0 to 1. Can you guess what the numbers correspond to? As is obvious, they represent the intensity of light in that particular pixel. Meaning that a value of zero corresponds to a black pixel and a value of 1 is a white pixel and any value in between will be varying shades of grey. This is the **greyscale representation of an image**.\n",

    "Well, in our implementation, we will make an obvious choice: Each image comprises 13x13= 169 pixels. We have stored a greyscale for each pixel. \n",
    "So the index for the weak classifier will simply be the index of the pixel that we are looking at. The weak classifier's threshold will be a greyscale value. As in our previous example, there will be also be a sign associated with our classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "So let's say that we are looking at the pixel with index (2,3) and have chosen a threshold greyscale value of 0.625 and the sign is +1. Then, if we give an image as input to this weak classifier, here's what will happen: Let this image have a value of 0.433 at the index (2,3). Thus, the output of our classifier will be -1 (as the sign is +1).\n",

Well, think of the images being **placed side-by-side**. So the length of all the images put together is simply the sum of their lengths and hence 13x1000 = 13000. The breadth is simply 13.\n",
