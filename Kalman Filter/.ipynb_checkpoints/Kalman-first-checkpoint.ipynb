    "Let me start it this way that before Rudolf Kalman (co-inventor of Kalman filtering), problems were divided in two distinct classes *Control Problems* (what value of acceleration should be provided to the car so that it climbs a certain incline with constant speed) and *Filtering Problem* (damn this noisy accelerometer, I can't get a clear value even at a fixed point). \n",
    "\n",
    "You might have guessed (if you care to read the brackets :P) that the two problems are not uncorrelated. To the un-initiated, take a scenario that the car has a noisy accelerometer and you want to control it's speed on the incline, so two problems in one. One way is to solve them independently, but that is too situation dependent and so there was a need for a *dynamic solution* for *filtering while controlling and vice versa*, essentially bringing the two separate problems under one roof.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is precisely what Kalman Filter does! Kalman Filter and it's non-linear extensions are essential elements in modern control theory. Lot of different applications ranging from filtering noisy sensor output to autonomous robot navigation uses Kalman Filter.\n",

Now we know that these cameras are noisy so we need a filtered estimate of the state of the ball finally (here the state is a vector of x,y,vx,vy). So let's get on with the system modeling first."
